NAME
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Thrift - A Thrift backend for ElasticSearch

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use ElasticSearch;
        my $e = ElasticSearch->new(
            servers     => 'search.foo.com:9500',
            transport   => 'thrift',
            timeout     => '10',
        );

    You need to have the "transport-thrift" plugin installed on your
    ElasticSearch server for this to work.

DESCRIPTION
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Thrift uses the Thrift to talk to
    ElasticSearch over sockets.

    Although the "thrift" interface has the right buzzwords (binary,
    compact, sockets), the generated Perl code is very slow. Until that is
    improved, I recommend one of the "http" backends instead.
